# ⚡️⚡️ SQL Portfolio: Project 1 ⚡️⚡️

#### Hi there! 
Welcome to my portfolio where I showcase my projects where I've analyzed data and created insights using various tools and techniques. 
This project is my second project since learning mySQL and this was challenging but very rewarding at best. 

#### Purpose: to showcase my ability to query data using basic to intermediate functions.  

##### ❗❗IMPORTANT NOTE❗❗
_Note that this project in its current state showcases my ability to query data with basic to intermediate functions, rather than focusing on data cleaning at this stage. As I progress in my coursework, my projects and techniques will evolve._
